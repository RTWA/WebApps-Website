# WebApps Application Cookie Policy
Last updated: 1st March 2022

This Cookie Policy explains how WebApps ("**Company**", "**we**", "**us**", or "**our**"). uses cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you use our application when it installed onto your own Web Server. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
 
Cookies set by the Application are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

## Why do we use cookies?

We use first party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for WebApps to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies.
 
The specific types of first party cookies served through WebApps and the purposes they perform are described below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online Properties you visit).

## How can I control cookies?

By using the Application, you declare that you accept the use of cookies. If you reject the use of cookies, cease use of the Application immediately.
 
Advertising is not used within WebApps, or any first party Apps or Plugins. However, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or [http://www.youronlinechoices.com/](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/).
 
The specific types of first cookies served through our Application and the purposes they perform are described in the table below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online Properties you visit).

## What about other tracking technologies, like web becaons?

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to the Application. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Application or opened an e-mail including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within the Application to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the Application from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

## How often do you update this cookie policy?

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
 
The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.

## Where can I get further information?
